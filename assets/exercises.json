Start out by curling your wrist upwards and exhaling. Slowly lower your wrists back down to the starting position while inhaling. Your forearms should be stationary as your wrist is the only movement needed to perform this exercise. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Variations: This exercise can also be performed sitting down by using your thighs as a resting position for your forearms. Your wrist can hang over your knees and the same movements as mentioned above can be performed. You can also use a dumbbell instead of a barbell.",
